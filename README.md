# EmoGes
Emotion and physical gestural expression are integral parts of social interaction; 
however, studies in the correlation between gestures and emotions are sparse and less conclusive. 
The ultimate goal of our study is to investigate the correlation between gestures and emotions.
In our study, we build software that is able to collect emotion data from Emotiv EPOC and gesture data from Leap Motion. 
In addition, a method based on time series analysis to investigate the correlation between emotion and gesture is introduced, 
followed by a case study to illustrate the mechanism of our software.
